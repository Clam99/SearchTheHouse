# SearchTheHouse
This is a project created by Sam Noyes and Jan Stratmann.  The project uses OpenGL to render a 3d house.  The player must walk around the house to collect objects/clues which lead them to the center of the maze, which is the final objective of the game.  It was made for the final project of CSC490, a course on computer graphics.
